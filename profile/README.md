# Welcome to the LaSDPC homepage!

The Distributed Systems and Concurrent Programming Laboratory (LaSDPC) is a research laboratory linked to the Computer Systems Department (SSC) of the ICMC/USP, which investigates new solutions applied to distributed computing.

Our Mission is to produce new distributed computing knowledge, in order to improve people´s life with computational systems more embracing, correct and with a better cost/benefit relation.

Our Vision is always to pursue excellence in both research and training of human resources.

Our Values are academic ethics, scientific production with focus on results, objective communication to disseminate knowledge, project´s sustainability, team management, people involved and transparency.

The techniques and tools produced in our laboratory are useful in several areas, such as parallel computing, distributed systems, computer networks, software engineering, performance evaluation, environment and educational computing.
